Sometimes you need to add private notes or internal documentation within your public knowledge base articles. Internal blocks let you create restricted sections that are only visible to your team members while keeping the rest of the article public. 

      To add an internal block: 

      -          Open the article editor     
     -          Click the "Insert Block" button in the toolbar     
     -          Add your private content inside the block     
       Any content placed within an internal block will only be visible to authenticated team members. When viewing the published article, your customers will not see these restricted sections at all, while your team members will see them clearly marked as internal content. 

      This feature is particularly useful for: 

      -          Adding internal context to public documentation     
     -          Including team-specific instructions or notes     
     -          Maintaining private troubleshooting steps     
     -          Documenting internal processes alongside public information     
       **Note:** Internal blocks are automatically styled differently in the editor to help you easily identify restricted content while writing.
