# Analytics: Bounce

Answer: (not found AND no action) Bounce is the relationship between people who sought some keyword on the Knowledge Base but found nothing relevant and didn't take any further action. This means that even if the search returned results, none of them were relevant to the user.Bounced happens in two situations:- Users found results, but they didn't click on any of the results.- Users didn't find results, therefore they didn't click on anything 

Question: 

what is the meaning of "Bounced" here ?
